	  <h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
	  <p>In our project, we developed a cloth simulator that is visually realistic and implemented several shaders to expand the artistic possibilities for stylizing the simulation. The cloth simulator uses classical mechanics equations and a dedicated cloth data structure to model the cloth as a 2D grid of point masses connected by an isometric spring lattice. Each point mass's motion on the grid is determined by the cumulative effect of the spring forces (following Hooke's Law) and external forces. The Verlet Integration technique was employed to propagate the position of each point mass forward in time, maintaining stability despite energy losses. Additionally, we addressed collisions with objects in the scene and self-collision effects to prevent the cloth from intersecting itself. We were impressed that the simulator was able to produce visually convincing cloth behavior with various material effects.</p>

		By increasing the spring constant, the stiffness of the spring is effectively increased. As we examine the images from left to right, we observe a two orders of magnitude decrease in the spring constant. It appears that for lower spring constants, such as <b><kbd>ks = 500 N/m</kbd></b>, the cloth becomes more pliable because the stretching is more pronounced compared to the <b><code>ks = 50,000 N/m</code></b> case, despite both simulations having the same gravitational field.

		  What about for <code>density</code>?
	  </b></p>
  
	  <p>
		The density is a property of the point masses and not the springs in the cloth. When we increase the density of the point masses, it has a comparable impact on the cloth to reducing the spring constant. This correlation can be clarified by Newton's Second Law, which states that the force applied to an object is proportional to its mass. As a result, the cloth becomes more responsive to external forces in the simulation, such as gravity.

	  <p>
		The impact of damping on cloth simulation is not very noticeable in static images. However, during live simulations, we observed that the damping value has a significant influence on how quickly the simulation settles into a state of rest. Higher damping values result in faster settling. The two images displayed depict simulations that have been integrated for a long time. The left image shows a simulation with 0% damping, where the cloth never reaches a state of rest, as evidenced by the small oscillations that persist in the cloth even after a long integration time (which may require zooming in to detect). On the other hand, the image on the right illustrates a simulation with at least some damping, where the cloth is entirely at rest, as seen by the smooth contours of the cloth.

	  <p>
		The parameter ks represents the stiffness of the cloth material. The higher the value of ks, the stiffer the cloth will be.
<ul><li>
With ks = 500 N/m, the cloth will be relatively soft and will form more wrinkles and folds. The shading will be smoother and more diffuse.</li>
<li>
With ks = 5,000 N/m, the cloth will be stiffer and will form fewer wrinkles and folds. The shading will be more pronounced, with sharper shadows and highlights.</li>
<li>
With ks = 50,000 N/m, the cloth will be extremely stiff and will form noticeably even less wrinkles and folds. The cloth may even appear somewhat metallic or plastic-like in texture.</li>
</ul>
Overall, the value of ks has a significant impact on the appearance and behavior of the cloth, affecting both its shape and the way light interacts with its surface.

		Increasing the spring stiffness of the cloth makes it more resistant to deformation and less likely to fold or bend. This can make the cloth appear more rigid and less flexible, which can result in fewer self-collisions. In the screenshots below, Ks has been increased to 7,500 N/m, causing the cloth to be more rigid and less prone to folding.

	</a>
  
	  <p><b>
	  What is a shader program and how vertex and fragment shaders work together to create lighting and material effects?
	  </b></p>
  
	  <p>
		A shader program is a special set of instructions written in a programming language like GLSL, which is parallelly executed by the graphics card to create visual effects in computer graphics. A shader program is composed of two main parts, namely the vertex shader and fragment shader.
		<br>
		<br>
		The vertex shader is responsible for transforming each vertex in a 3D model into its correct position in 3D space by applying different transformations such as scaling, rotating, and translating. Additionally, it calculates the lighting information (such as diffuse and specular lighting) for each vertex based on the light sources' positions, and sends this information to the fragment shader.
		<br>
		<br>
		The fragment shader, on the other hand, takes the interpolated lighting information calculated by the vertex shader and material properties (such as color and texture) of the object being rendered, and computes the final color of each pixel. It can also apply different effects like shadows, reflections, or transparency based on the object's material properties.

	  </p>
  
  
	  <p><b>
	  The Blinn-Phong shading model 
	  </b></p>
  
	  <p>
		The Blinn-Phong model calculates lighting for each pixel on a surface by taking into account three types of lighting: ambient lighting, diffuse lighting, and specular lighting.
		<ul>
		<li>Ambient lighting is the amount of light present in the environment, and it is the same for all surfaces in the scene. It is typically a low-intensity light that provides a basic level of illumination to the entire scene.</li>

		<li>Diffuse lighting is the amount of light that is scattered in all directions by a surface, and it depends on the surface's angle relative to the light source. The more perpendicular the surface is to the light source, the brighter the diffuse lighting will be.</li>

		<li>Specular lighting is the amount of light that is reflected by a surface, and it creates highlights on the surface. The specular lighting depends on the angle of incidence (the angle between the incoming light and the surface normal) and the angle of reflection (the angle between the outgoing light and the surface normal).</li>
		</ul>
		The final color of a pixel is the sum of ambient, diffuse, and specular lighting. The Blinn-Phong model is widely used because it is computationally efficient and produces visually pleasing results. It can also be easily modified to include other lighting effects, such as shadows and reflections.
	  </p>

		In the second set of images, the sphere's surface is sampled at 16 lateral and 16 longitudinal coordinates, resulting in a total of 16x16 vertices. Bump mapping is visually superior to displacement mapping at this low sampling rate, as evidenced by the blocky appearance of the sphere in the 16x16 displacement mapping image. This blockiness occurs because the fragment shader is interpolating physical height changes over the sphere from a small number of samples. However, the texture itself has high-frequency content over the sphere that cannot be matched by the surface deformations due to the low sampling rate. In contrast, the last set of images shows 128x128 samples on the sphere, which is a high enough sampling rate for the surface deformations to match the texture's high-frequency content. Here, displacement mapping accurately represents both the shading of the texture and the physical deformations on the sphere defined by the texture.
