<h2 align="middle">Overview</h2>
<p>In this project, I implemented a program with the functions of triangle rasterization,
   antialiasing, graph transforms, color interpolating and texture mapping. During the
   completion, I learned how to check if a point is inside the triangle, antialiase using
   supersampling and then downsampling, interpolate color or map texture using barycentric
   coordinates, and find correct mipmap level for level sampling.
</p>

<h2 align="middle">Section I: Rasterization</h2>

<h3 align="middle">Part 1: Rasterizing single-color triangles</h3>
<p>To rasterize a triangle, we scan all pixels in the bounding box of the triangle. For
   each pixel, check a sample point in the center of it. If the point is in the triangle
   (including boundaries), color the pixel.
</p>
<p>My algorithm exactly checks each sample within the bounding box of the triangle.
   Thus it's no worse than one that does the same thing.

<h3 align="middle">Part 2: Antialiasing triangles</h3>
<p>My supersampling algorithm uses a sample buffer other than the frame buffer. The sample
   buffer actually contains sample_rate pixels corresponding to each one pixel of the frame
   buffer. This allows us to sample sqrt(sample_rate) * sqrt(sample_rate) locations for one
   pixel of the frame buffer. After supersampling, the sample buffer then down sampled to the 
   frame buffer using the average color of the sample_rate pixels for each frame pixel.
   Supersampling can make the edge more blurred and looks smoother, thus can reduce aliasing
   artifacts. The "supersampling" and "downsampling" processes are added in the beginning and the
   end of my rasterization pipeline respectively.

<p>The different results observed is mainly because supersampling blurs the edges and makes them smoother.</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 4: Barycentric coordinates</h3>
<p>Barycentric coordinates are a method to represent a point inside a triangle using three
   parameters that add up to 1. Each parameter represents the proportional distance to the 
   side that opposite to the corresponding vertex. We can use the barycentric coordinates 
   to smoothly interpolate color inside the triangle. Take the image below as an example:
</p>
<div align="middle">
  <img src="images/6.png" align="middle" width="800px" />
</div>
<p>In this image, for any point P inside the triangle, we assume that the proportional 
  distances to the side that opposite to the vertices A, B, C of the triangle are p_A, 
  p_B, p_C respectively. Then the barycentric coordinate of P is (p_A, p_B, p_C). Given the 
  color of the vertices c_A, c_B, c_C, we can interpolate the color of P using
  c_P = p_A * c_A + p_B * c_B + p_C * c_C.

<h3 align="middle">Part 5: "Pixel sampling" for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Pixel sampling is a method of sampling texture value at a point by considering its surrounding
   texture sample pixels. In texture mapping, we first get the barycentric coordinate of the target point
   P in the triangle ABC. Then determine the coordinate of P in the texture space from the coordinates
   of A, B and C in the texture space as well as the barycentric coordinate. After that, we can
   use the indicated pixel sampling method to get the color of P.
</p>
<p>Two different pixel sampling methods are used in this program. Nearest-pixel sampling determines
   the color value at a point by finding its nearest texture sample pixel and using that pixel's color.
   Bilinear sampling determines the color value at a point by taking a weighted average of the 
   four closest texture sample pixels' color. In comparison, bilinear sampling produces smoother
   texture mapping results.
</p>
<p>Below is an example where bilinear sampling clearly defeats nearest sampling.</p>
<div align="middle">
  <table style="width=100%">
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/8.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling at 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/9.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Nearest sampling at 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
    <br>
    <tr>
      <td>
        <img src="images/10.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling at 1 sample per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
      <td>
        <img src="images/11.png" align="middle" width="400px"/>
        <figcaption align="middle">Bilinear sampling at 16 samples per pixel</figcaption>
      </td>
    </tr>
  </table>
</div>
<p>We can find that the letter "O" in bilinear sampling is much more uniform and 
   smoother than that in nearest sampling at the same sampling rate.</p>
<p>The large difference can occur between the two methods in several conditions. First is 
   when an image is obviously scaled. In these cases, nearest sampling will produce a 
   more "pixelated" image, while bilinear sampling will produce a smoother image. Second is 
   when an image has sharp edges. Nearest sampling will remain the sharp features while
   bilinear sampling will blur the edges. These are because nearest sampling only considers
   the nearest pixel, but bilinear sampling mixes the colors of four nearest pixels, resulting 
   in an image with more blended features.
</p>

<h3 align="middle">Part 6: "Level sampling" with mipmaps for texture mapping</h3>
<p>Level sampling is a method of choosing appropriate mipmap level to sample in order to 
   avoid blurring and aliasing. My program first compute the continuous level number D, and
   then determine the mipmap level to sample according to D and the level sampling method used.
</p>
<p>Pixel sampling is fast and doesn't need extra memory, but it sometimes won't remove aliasing
   artifacts well in some scaled images. Level sampling is also fast, and it needs some extra
   memory for mipmap. It generally performs better than pixel sampling in antialiasing but sometimes
   can cause the image overblurred. Increasing the number of samples per pixel is usually the 
   most powerful in antialiasing, but will spend a lot of time and need large amounts of extra memory.
</p>
<p>Below are the four versions of an image using different sampling technique combinations.</p>
